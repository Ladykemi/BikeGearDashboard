# BikeGearDashboard

## Project Overview
The BikeGearDashboard project was created using **Excel** to analyze bike sales data, uncover customer trends, and generate actionable insights for management. The project was completed both individually and as part of the 10Alytics program team assignments.

The dashboard provides a clear view of historical sales data and helps management make informed decisions regarding inventory, promotions, and sales strategies.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Inventory Management:**
  - Prioritize stock levels for high-volume items such as tires, tubes, bottles, and helmets.
  - Reduce low-performing products to prevent overstocking.
  - Stock up on best-selling items (tires, helmets, bottles) before peak seasons: May, June, November, December.
  - Reduce inventory during low-demand months: July–September.

- **Sales & Promotions:**
  - Promote top products with bundle offers (e.g., cyclist kit with tires + helmet).
  - Use seasonal discounts or promotions to clear underperforming items like vests and bike stands.
  - Launch major promotions and campaigns in April–June and November–December.
  - Run discounts or clearance sales during low months (July–September) to improve sales.
